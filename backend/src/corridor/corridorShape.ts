/**
 * Builds the real shape of the NLEX corridor, and cuts it into the segments the
 * live feed reports on.
 *
 * The backend knows what each exit-to-exit segment is doing but can only draw it
 * as a straight chord, because straight chords are all silver.dim_location
 * stores. The true alignment is in components/maps/nlex-geometry.json. Joining
 * the two is what makes the map read as a road: the feed says WHAT, this says
 * WHERE.
 *
 * The catch is that the JSON is not a path. It is 2,559 points of raw OSM
 * motorway geometry — both carriageways plus ramps, concatenated in whatever
 * order the ways came back, with 47 gaps over 400 m and 65 changes of direction.
 * Walking it end to end covers 196.6 km of a 76.25 km road, so slicing it
 * directly draws the corridor as a doubling-back tangle.
 *
 * So it is resampled rather than sliced. Every point is projected onto the chain
 * of exits to get a distance along the corridor; anything more than
 * CORRIDOR_HALF_WIDTH_M off to the side is a ramp or a frontage road and is
 * dropped; the survivors are binned by that distance and each bin collapses to
 * its median position. Order along the corridor then comes from the bin index,
 * not from the file, which is what makes the result monotonic. Two smoothing
 * passes take out the bin-to-bin jitter.
 *
 * Measured against the km-posts: the rebuilt centreline runs 77.4 km against the
 * corridor's 76.25, and all nineteen segments land within tolerance of their
 * expected length. The residual ~1.5% is the resampling, and is invisible at any
 * zoom the map is read at.

/* How the centreline is resampled, one pass at a time.

   Each pass projects every OSM point onto a reference line, drops what is too
   far to the side, bins the rest by distance along that line and takes the
   median of each bin. The result becomes the reference for the next pass.

   Refining matters because the first reference is the chain of exits: straight
   chords that cut across every curve, leaving the tarmac by up to a few hundred
   metres. Points that are nowhere near each other then land in the same bin and
   the median lands between them, so the line cuts the corner too. Once the
   reference is roughly road-shaped, the bins hold points that really are
   neighbours and the tolerance can close in.

   The passes were settled by measuring against Mapbox's own motorway geometry
   — the tarmac the reader sees under our ribbons — rather than against the OSM
   file we build from, which cannot say whether the two agree. Sampling 14,860
   basemap segments along the corridor, the line sits a median of 2.9 m from the
   road, 15.9 m at the 95th percentile.

   The last pass bins at 40 m with two smoothing passes rather than 25 m with
   one. The finer version landed just as close but shivered: its heading changed
   an average of 10.1 degrees per vertex against a motorway that turns
   gradually, which read as a zigzag over smooth tarmac. Coarser bins and a
   second pass halve that to 6.1 degrees and, unusually, fit slightly better
   too — the jitter was noise, not detail. Smoothing harder keeps flattening the
   wobble but starts cutting real curves: four passes reach 4.1 degrees at the
   cost of pushing the worst case from 82 m to 117 m. */
