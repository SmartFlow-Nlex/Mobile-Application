/**
 * PORTED FROM THE DASHBOARD - keep in step with it.
 *
 * Source: SmartFlow-Nlex/SmartFlow-NLEX, branch Dashboard,
 *         Front-End-Dashboard/lib/corridor-status.ts
 *
 * Why this exists rather than reading /api/dashboard/corridor-status/full:
 * that endpoint aggregates in SQL, and the dashboard stopped using it because
 * the two pipelines disagreed. Its own comment says the SQL panel "would call a
 * stretch congested on the strength of a jam the map had thrown away" - the SQL
 * side applied the NLEX street-name test but not the geometric one, so jams
 * near the corridor but not on it counted. The mobile app was still reading
 * that older pipeline, so it could show different numbers from the dashboard
 * for the same moment.
 *
 * This IS what the deployed dashboard renders from - confirmed by matching its
 * counts against both pipelines while they disagreed: the dashboard showed 4
 * congested / 36 clear, this derivation gave 4/36, and the SQL endpoint gave
 * 5/35. Earlier they had agreed only because no jam was being rejected at that
 * moment, which is a coincidence and not a check.
 *
 * Known flaw, inherited deliberately: it requires every vertex of a jam to lie
 * within 200m of the centreline, and Balintawak's toll plaza is wider than
 * that, so a real level-4 jam there measured 353m off and was discarded. The
 * dashboard has the same blind spot. Matching it is the requirement, so this
 * stays until the dashboard team fix it upstream - at which point both
 * correct together.
